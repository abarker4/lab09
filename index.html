                <h2>Platform</h2>
                <h3 id="climate">Climate Action: Protecting Mother Earth and Humanity</h3>

                <p>Enact an emergency Green New Deal to turn the tide on climate change, revive the economy and make wars for oil obsolete. Initiate a WWII-scale national mobilization to halt climate change, the greatest threat to humanity in our history.Create 20 million jobs by transitioning to 100% clean renewable energy by 2030, and investing in public transit, sustainable agriculture, conservation and restoration of critical infrastructure, including ecosystems.
                Implement a Just Transition that empowers those communities and workers most impacted by climate change and the transition to a green economy. Ensure that any worker displaced by the shift away from fossil fuels will receive full income and benefits as they transition to alternative work.
                Enact energy democracy based on public, community and worker ownership of our energy system. Treat energy as a human right.
                </p>

                <h3 id="poverty">End Poverty</h3>

                    <p>
                        Guarantee economic human rights, including access to food, water, housing, and utilities, with effective anti-poverty programs to ensure every American a life of dignity. Establish the right to a living wage job.Reform public assistance to be a true safety net that empowers participants and provides a decent standard of living. Free universal child care.
                    </p>

                <h3 id="health">Health Care as a Right</h3>    

                    <p>
                        Establish an improved “Medicare for All” single-payer public health program to provide everyone with quality health care, at huge savings by eliminating the $400 billion annually spent on  the paperwork and bureaucracy of health insurance. No co-pays, premiums or deductibles. Access to all health care services, including mental health, dental, and vision. Include everyone, period. No restrictions based on pre-existing illness, employment, immigration status, age, or any other category.
                        Eliminate the cancer of health insurance, which adds costs while reducing access to health care.
                        End overcharging for prescription drugs by using bulk purchasing negotiations.
                        Eliminate health disparities in communities of color and low-income communities. Ensure easy access to health care in communities of color, including community health centers. Allow full access to contraceptive and reproductive care. Expand women's access to "morning after" contraception by lifting the Obama Administration's ban. Avoid chronic diseases by investing in essential community health infrastructure such as local, fresh, organic food systems, pollution-free renewable energy, phasing out toxic chemicals, and active transportation such as bike paths and safe sidewalks that dovetail with public transit. Ensure that consumers have essential information for making informed food choices by expanding product labeling requirements for country of origin, GMO content, toxic chemical ingredients, and fair trade practices. Prioritize preventive health care, including physical activity, healthy nutrition and pollution prevention.
